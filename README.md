Project AVA:

With the rampant increase in the number of abductions in India, it is high time we start researching and developing efficient technological solution that are meant to tackle this widespread social and security issue. Project AVA, an augmented backpack for young school going kids, is a step in that direction. With AVA, we have combined the best of both software and hardware to ensure that children can feel safe when they are out of home and parents can regularly monitor their whereabouts.
